## Setup tips

We recommend using a virtual environment to manage python dependencies (for instance, using `conda` or `pyenv`). You'll need Python >=3.7 (newer versions preferred)

Dependencies can be found in the `requirements.txt` file. To install these, `pip install -r requirements.txt` with your environment activated.

If you're brand-new to Python, VSCode, or are wondering how to get things running on Windows, check out some more extensive tips [here](getting_started_windows.md). This is entirely optional - you might have your own preferred workflow, so go ahead and use that.
